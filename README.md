# [Diep.io](http://diep.io/) Rainbow Fade

Allows you to have a tank that fades through a rainbow.

## Usage

This is a [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) extension, so if you have that installed, installation of this script should be as easy as [clicking here](https://github.com/haykam821/Diep.io-Rainbow-Fade/raw/master/index.user.js) and clicking the Install button.

## Restrictions

As of right now, there are two hardcoded restrictions:

* The only set of colors it fades through is a typical rainbow
* It only changes the self FFA color

Both of these restrictions can be overcome by directly editing the script, but it's best to wait until I've made a UI for it.
